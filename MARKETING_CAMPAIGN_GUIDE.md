## Overview

This guide explains how to create and run targeted marketing campaigns for your property listings (villas, premium farmlands, and city plots) on Instagram and Facebook. It covers step-by-step instructions, examples, and best practices tailored for YUG Estates.

## 1. Prepare Your Campaign Assets

- **Property Images/Videos:** High-quality visuals of each property (interior, exterior, aerial, location highlights).
- **Ad Copy:**
  - Emphasize your company motto: Only premium villas, selective farmlands, and plots in prime locations with clean legal work.
  - Example:
    > "Invest in a luxury villa with future returns. Only the best, legally clear properties in premium locations."
- **Call-to-Action (CTA):** "Enquire Now", "Book a Visit", "Learn More".
- **Landing Page:** Each ad should link to a dedicated property page or a lead form on your website.

## 2. Set Up Facebook Business Manager

- Go to [Facebook Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/).
- Create a business account (if you don't have one).
- Connect your Instagram account and Facebook Page.

---

## 3. Install Facebook Pixel

- Add the [Facebook Pixel](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755) to your website for tracking user actions (visits, leads, etc.).
- (Optional) Set up [Meta Conversions API](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2041148702652965) for advanced tracking.

## 4. Audience Targeting Strategy

Target users based on:

- **Location:** Use geo-targeting (cities, regions, or radius around properties).
- **Income:** Target by household income (where available).
- **Investment Interest:** Target interests like "real estate investing", "property investment", "luxury real estate", "agriculture", "farmland".
- **Behavioral:** Use "likely to move", "recently moved", "engaged shoppers".
- **Custom Audiences:** Upload your own leads or retarget website visitors.
- **Lookalike Audiences:** Find new people similar to your best customers.

**Example Targeting:**

- Location: Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai
- Income: Top 10% in selected cities
- Interests: "Luxury real estate", "Farmland investment"

## 5. Create Your Campaign

  - **Audience:** Use the targeting options above.
  - **Placements:** Choose Instagram, Facebook, or both.
  - **Budget & Schedule:** Set your daily or lifetime budget.
- Create your ad:

## 6. Optimize and Track

- Use Pixel data to retarget users who visited but didn’t convert.
- Test different creatives, copy, and targeting (A/B testing).

---

## 7. Compliance

## 8. (Optional) Personalization & Automation

- Set up dynamic ads or retargeting campaigns for each segment.

---

## 9. (Optional) CRM Integration
